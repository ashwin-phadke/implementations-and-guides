# Implementations-and-guides

There is an extensive Wiki availale for the code in this repository as well as guides for basics in python and computer vision and explanations of the codes included. These are from the things I have learned from various tutorials online and tried out by adding new functionalities.
The Wiki also hosts step by step guide to installing common tools required majory for computer vision tasks. The following list is a gist of all such available pages in the wiki.
More will be added later.
